Odd or even game using camera and reinforcement learning in raspberry pi

The train.py is the program for training the images for digit recognition from hand gestures

The try_application program runs the loaded model through opencv and the hand needs to be shown in the rectangular box and the box is the roi for Detection

you can find the model here, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NCmlR5hoTFGmGxRn2UYpPkRU9ocjOdrc,This model was trained by using the dataset in images2 folder. Please check the images to see how the dataset is looking like.

There is also another model I trained with another dataset, https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5sZ8q5iqYbtRVpqMU4yRlRDdEU/view
You can also see the dataset, which is in images1. Check it also
