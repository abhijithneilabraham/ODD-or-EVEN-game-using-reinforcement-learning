Odd or even game using camera and reinforcement learning in raspberry pi

The train.py is the program for training the images for digit recognition from hand gestures

The try_application program runs the loaded model through opencv and the hand needs to be shown in the rectangular box and the box is the roi for Detection

you can find the model here, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NCmlR5hoTFGmGxRn2UYpPkRU9ocjOdrc
There is also another model I trained with another dataset, https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5sZ8q5iqYbtRVpqMU4yRlRDdEU/view
